Implemented features:
1. Follow Camera
   The camera is setup in a way that it's position and orientation relative to Jammo do not change at all while moving. As for the movement it does work with both WASD and arrow keys. Left and right will rotate Jammo in that respective direction. There is one thing where while moving backwards the camera becomes very shakey for some reason that I could not figure out.
3. Realistic Terrain
  Using a mix of different stamps and terrain tools were done to create the terrain. There are mountains that surrond the area as well as hills and valleys for Jammo to walk around. There are also two flatter areas where the castle and village are located. The ground is also painted with different materials marking out a dirt path, grass, and sand. 
5. Trees & Foliage
   5 unique foliage models and grass were implemented around the terrain to bring life into the scene. They are also mixed and varied so that it does not ever feel too stagnant.
7. Baronâ€™s Castle
   A castle was made in blender and includes the outer walls, inner keep, 
9. Small Village
    
11. Areas of Water
    2 seperate areas of water were added, a small pond and moat around the castle. There is also a shoreline around the pong and boat that sits on the shoreline. The water prefab was also edited to create a realistic look.

Rendering Pipeline: None (Render Pipeline Assist)
